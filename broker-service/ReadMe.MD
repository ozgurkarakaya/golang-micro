go get github.com/go-chi/chi/v5
//chi is a lightweight, idiomatic and composable router 
for building Go HTTP services. It's especially
good at helping you write large REST API services 
that are kept maintainable as your project 
grows and changes. chi is built on the new context 
package introduced in Go 1.7 to handle signaling, 
cancelation and request-scoped values across a 
handler chain.
